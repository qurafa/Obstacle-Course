# Obstacle Course
Obstacle course game, where we measure the difficulty faced while navigating through the course.
The objective is to navigate from the starting point to the end, where afterwards you have to indicate the level of difficulty of completing the course. This is done multiple times with the data stored on a .csv file.

*Controls*
- You make use of the W-A-S-D keys
- W to move forward
- A to move left
- S to move backwards
- D to move right

Made using the [Path Creator Project](https://github.com/SebLague/Path-Creator), to design the paths that the ball moves accross
